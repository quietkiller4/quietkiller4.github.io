									Dear Travis,</br></br>
									 
									I am writing to express interest in your Game Programming Preproduction class. This is my first choice for my senior project. I want to work in a group environment in my career upon graduation. Showing my versatility in working on team projects makes me a great fit to be in this class. 
									 
									In my portfolio you will see completed projects where I worked as a team as well as assignments showing my code. Here is what I will be showcasing in my portfolio: 2D COD Zombies, my involvement in the Kricker Innovation Hub Start up weekend 1st place Brain-Rot project, an assignment from UnReal Engine 5, and an assignment from Unity.
									 
									I would be excited for an opportunity to join the preproduction senior project class, and I am confident that I would become a valued member of the team. Thank you for taking the time to review my letter, resume, and portfolio. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
									 
									
								</br></br>Sincerely, 
									
							</br>Kevin Keller Jr.
